## Course Project

For this project, first I loaded the data with the functions:

features<- Has the column names of the data

activity_label<- number of activity performed

subject_test<- Id of the subject tested

x_test <- values obtained on device

y_test <- activity performed by subject

subject_train<- Id of the subject tested

x_train <- values obtained on device

y_train <- activity performed by subject

Then I proceed to merge the tables

x_df<-Device data merged
y_df<-Activity data merged
subject_df<-subject data merged 

data_df<- all data combined

Then I proceed to select the means and the standard deviation:

final_df<- Data frame with selected data

Tidy_df<- Data frame with mean result by group and activity
