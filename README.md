## Course Project
The objective is to consolidate all data from the mobile data in one tidy dataframe that can be analyzed easily.

In the process the following variables where created

features<- Has the column names of the data

activity_label<- number of activity performed

subject_test<- Id of the subject tested

x_test <- values obtained on device

y_test <- activity performed by subject

subject_train<- Id of the subject tested

x_train <- values obtained on device

y_train <- activity performed by subject


Then I proceed to merge the tables

x_df<-Device data merged
y_df<-Activity data merged
subject_df<-subject data merged 

data_df<- all data combined

After I proceed to select the means and the standard deviation:

final_df<- Data frame with selected data

Tidy_df<- Data frame with mean result by group and activity
